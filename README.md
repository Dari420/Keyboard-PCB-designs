# Keyboard-PCB-designs
Repository for various keyboard PCB's I design. Folders with a "!" are project folders. Folders that end with ".pretty" are libary folders. 
Gerber Files are the files you send to various PCB manufacturers in case you want to make the PCB's.
Pretty much it, I'm a rookie so be warned that these may not be the best designs, but I hope you find at least one thing useful here :)
