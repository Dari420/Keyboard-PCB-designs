# Keyboard-PCB-designs
Repository for random keyboard PCB's I design. Folders with a "!" are project folders. Folders that end with ".pretty" are libary folders. 
Gerber Files are the files you send to various PCB manufacturers in case you want to make the PCB's.
More complete and extensive projects will be in their own repositories, these are mostly prototypes and random tests.
Pretty much it, I'm a rookie so be warned that these may not be the best designs, but I hope you find at least one thing useful here :)
